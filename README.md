# Data-Summariser
A shiny app to drag and drop csv files to get fast data summaries of the data set.

* This application is a student project which was built using R, and Shiny
* Javascript allows for data drag and drop and data refresh.
* A little bit of CSS was used to style the dashboard.

# Motivation

This tool helps to look at a dataset visually without running any code. This *might* help in
reducing the time needed to understand the data. One **drawback** of this is that, it only works with *.csv* files at the moment. This tool borrows the idea from
this [Stackoverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36108705/drag-and-drop-data-into-shiny-app).

# Demo
## Iris Dataset
For a simple demonstration, let us use the `test.csv` file which has the Iris Flower data set.This data set was created using the `iris` in-built dataset in R.
